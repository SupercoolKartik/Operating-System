### **First Come First Serve (FCFS) Disk Scheduling**

#### Definition:  
FCFS is a simple disk scheduling algorithm that processes requests in the order they arrive, without considering the current position of the disk head or the distance between requests.

---

#### How It Works:
- Requests are added to a queue in the order they are received.
- The disk head processes each request sequentially, starting from the first in the queue.
- No reordering of requests takes place.

---
#### Example:

- **Initial disk head position**: 50
- **Request sequence**: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67

The head moves in sequence:

1. 50 → 98
2. 98 → 183
3. 183 → 37
4. 37 → 122 → 14 → 124 → 65 → 67

**Total Seek Time**:  
Add the absolute movements:  
|98 - 50| + |183 - 98| + ... = 236 cylinders.

---

#### Advantages:
1. **Simple to implement**: Minimal complexity in logic.
2. **Fair**: Requests are processed in the exact order they arrive, **preventing starvation**.

#### Disadvantages:
1. **High seek time**: Head movement is not optimized, causing inefficiency.
2. **No prioritization**: All requests are treated equally, which may delay critical tasks.
3. **Inefficient for scattered requests**: Leads to long delays for distant requests.

---

#### Use Cases:
- Suitable for systems with light workloads and fairness requirements.
- Rarely used in modern systems due to its inefficiency. Advanced algorithms like **SSTF** or **LOOK** are preferred in high-performance environments.
