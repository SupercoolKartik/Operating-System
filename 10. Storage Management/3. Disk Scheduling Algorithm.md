**Disk Scheduling Algorithms** are techniques used to determine the order in which disk I/O requests are processed to minimize seek time, maximize throughput, and improve overall system performance. Below are the main disk scheduling algorithms explained simply:

#### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **How it works**: Requests are processed in the order they arrive.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple to implement.
    - Fair because every request gets equal priority.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can result in high seek times if requests are scattered.
    - Not optimal for minimizing movement.


#### 2. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- **How it works**: Selects the request closest to the current head position, regardless of direction.
- **Advantages**:
    - Reduces seek time compared to FCFS.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can lead to **starvation** (some requests might not be served if closer requests keep arriving).


#### 3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- **How it works**: The disk arm moves in one direction (up or down the tracks) and processes all requests until it reaches the end, then reverses direction.
- **Advantages**:
    - Reduces the variance in seek time.
    - Ensures all requests are served in a predictable order.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can result in longer wait times for requests at the end of the queue.


#### 4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
- **How it works**: Similar to SCAN, but the head only moves in one direction (e.g., up). After reaching the end, it jumps back to the beginning without processing requests in reverse.
- **Advantages**:
    - Provides a more uniform wait time than SCAN.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Skips requests in the reverse direction, which might increase overall travel distance.


#### 5. LOOK
- **How it works**: Similar to SCAN, but the head only moves as far as the last request in the current direction, then reverses. It does not go to the physical end of the disk unless there are requests there.
- **Advantages**:
    - More efficient than SCAN by avoiding unnecessary movement.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Performance depends on the distribution of requests.


#### 6. C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
- **How it works**: Similar to C-SCAN, but the head only moves as far as the last request in one direction. It jumps back to the start without going to the physical end.
- **Advantages**:
    - Reduces unnecessary head movement.
    - More uniform response time compared to LOOK.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Slightly more complex to implement than LOOK.


#### 7. Priority Scheduling
- **How it works**: Requests are served based on priority rather than position or arrival time.
- **Advantages**:
    - Allows critical requests to be prioritized.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Low-priority requests might suffer from starvation.


### Comparing Algorithms:

|**Algorithm**|**Seek Time**|**Fairness**|**Starvation?**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|FCFS|High|High|No|Simplicity|
|SSTF|Low|Medium|Yes|Seek Time Critical|
|SCAN|Medium|High|No|Predictability|
|C-SCAN|Medium|Medium|No|Uniform Wait Times|
|LOOK|Low|High|No|Seek Optimization|
|C-LOOK|Low|Medium|No|Efficient Scheduling|

### Conclusion:

The choice of disk scheduling algorithm depends on the system's requirements:
- **Real-time systems** prioritize fairness and quick response times, so FCFS or Priority Scheduling might be suitable.
- **High-performance systems** aim to minimize seek time, so SSTF, LOOK, or C-LOOK are better choices.
