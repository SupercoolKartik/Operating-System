#### **SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm (Elevator Algorithm)**

#### Definition:  
The SCAN algorithm moves the disk head in one direction, **servicing all requests in its path**, until it reaches the **last track (or the edge)** in that direction. Then it **reverses direction** and services the requests along the way back.

---
#### How It Works:
1. The disk head starts moving in one direction (e.g., towards the higher-numbered cylinders).
2. As it moves, it services all the pending requests that are in its path.
3. When the head reaches the **last cylinder** (highest or lowest number, depending on direction), it reverses direction.
4. The process repeats, moving back and forth like an elevator.

#### Example:

- **Disk size**: 0 to 199
- **Current head position**: 50
- **Request sequence**: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
- **Initial direction**: Towards the higher-numbered cylinders

**Steps**:

1. Start at **50**, move towards **199** (highest cylinder).  
    Service requests: **65**, **67**, **98**, **122**, **124**, and **183**.
2. Once the head reaches the **end (199)**, it reverses direction.
3. On the way back, service requests: **37** and **14**.

**Seek Order**:  
50 → 65 → 67 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183 → 199 → 37 → 14

**Total Seek Time**:  
Add up the movement of the head. For example:  
|50 - 65| + |65 - 67| + |67 - 98| + ... + |199 - 37| + |37 - 14|

#### Advantages:
1. **Fairer than SSTF**: Requests in both directions eventually get serviced.
2. **More predictable**: Ensures requests are handled in a systematic order.
3. **Lower average seek time**: Reduces unnecessary movement compared to FCFS.

#### Disadvantages:
1. **Delay for far requests**: Requests in the opposite direction wait until the head reverses.
2. **Excessive movement**: The head always goes to the last track, even if no requests are at the very end.
3. **Not optimal**: Still may result in unnecessary movement to the disk’s extremes.

#### Use Cases:

- Suitable for systems where fairness and reduced starvation are essential.
- Commonly used in multi-user systems and older disk scheduling methods.

###### Improved Variants:  
Algorithms like **[[LOOK]]** and **[[C-LOOK]]** optimize SCAN by eliminating unnecessary movement to disk extremes.
