### **LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm**

#### Definition:
The **LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm** is a variant of the SCAN algorithm, with a key difference: **it doesn't go to the last track unless there is a request there**. Instead, the disk head **"looks" ahead** to determine the furthest request in the current direction and stops there before reversing direction.

---

#### How LOOK Works
1. **Initial Direction**: The disk head moves in a specified direction (towards higher or lower track numbers).
2. **Servicing Requests**: It services all the requests along the way in the current direction.
3. **Stopping Point**: Unlike SCAN, it **does not go all the way to the last track** (e.g., 0 or 199). Instead, it stops at the **last request in that direction**.
4. **Reversing Direction**: Once the last request in the current direction is serviced, the head reverses direction and services requests on its way back.

#### Example Walkthrough

- **Disk size**: 0 to 199
- **Initial head position**: 50
- **Request sequence**: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
- **Initial direction**: **Towards higher cylinders**

---

**Steps:**

1. **Starting at 50**, moving upwards:
    - Service **65 → 67 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183**.
    - No request beyond **183**, so stop there and reverse direction.
  
2. **Reversing direction**, moving downwards:
    - Service **37 → 14**.
    - No requests beyond **14**, so stop there.


**Seek Order:**

50 → 65 → 67 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183 → 37 → 14

#### Difference Between SCAN and LOOK:
1. **SCAN**: Moves to the end of the disk (e.g., track 0 or 199) before reversing, even if no requests are at the extreme tracks.
2. **LOOK**: Stops at the **last request** in the current direction and reverses immediately.

#### Advantages:
- **Reduced Seek Time**: The head does not travel to unnecessary tracks, saving time.
- **Improved Efficiency**: It skips unused tracks, making it faster than SCAN.
- **Balanced Servicing**: Requests in both directions are handled, ensuring fairness.

---
#### Disadvantages:
- **Potential Starvation**: Requests far from the current direction may face delays.
- **Complexity**: Requires dynamically checking the farthest request in the current direction.
- **Less Predictable**: The direction reversal is based on request distribution, which may vary.
- It may not be suitable for real-time systems where fast response times are critical, as it does not prioritize requests based on their urgency or importance.

In summary, LOOK optimizes head movement by avoiding unnecessary travel to the edges of the disk, making it more efficient than SCAN while maintaining fairness in servicing requests.
