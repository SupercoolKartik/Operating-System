**Hard Disks:** Hard disks are secondary storage devices we can use to store data. Most modern computers use hard disks to store large amounts of data.

The architecture of a hard disk consists of several physical components that include:
- Platters
- Spindle
- Read/write heads
- Tracks
- Sectors

#### Platters

Hard disks are organized as a concentric stack of disks. An individual disk is referred to as a **platter**.

Each platter consists of two surfaces: a lower and an upper surface.

### Spindle

The platters within the hard disk are connected by a **spindle** that runs through the middle of the platters.

The spindle moves in a unidirectional manner along its axis (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

The movement of the spindle causes the platters to rotate as well.

### Tracks

Each surface of a platter consists of a fixed number of **tracks**. These are circular areas on the surface of a platter that decrease in circumference as we move towards the center of the platter.

Data is first written to the outermost track.

### Sectors

Each track is divided into a fixed number of **sectors**. Sectors divide track sections and store data.
