### **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) Disk Scheduling**

#### Definition:  
The **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)** algorithm **selects the disk I/O request that is closest to the current position of the disk head**. This minimizes the movement of the disk arm and reduces seek time compared to FCFS.

---
#### How It Works:
1. The disk head starts at the initial position.
2. Among all pending requests, the request closest to the current position is served next.
3. This process continues until all requests are completed.

---

#### Example:

- **Initial disk head position**: 50
- **Request sequence**: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67

**Steps**:

1. Start at 50. The closest request is **37** → Move to 37.
2. From 37, the closest request is **14** → Move to 14.
3. From 14, the closest request is **65** → Move to 65.
4. From 65, the closest request is **67** → Move to 67.
5. From 67, the closest request is **98** → Move to 98.
6. From 98, the closest request is **122** → Move to 122.
7. From 122, the closest request is **124** → Move to 124.
8. From 124, the closest request is **183** → Move to 183.

**Total Seek Time**:  
Add absolute movements:  
|50 - 37| + |37 - 14| + |14 - 65| + ... = 208 cylinders.

#### Advantages:
1. **Lower seek time**: Minimizes head movement compared to FCFS.
2. **More efficient**: Prioritizes requests closer to the current head position.

#### Disadvantages:
1. **Starvation**: Requests far from the current head position may suffer long delays if closer requests keep arriving.
2. **Complexity**: **Requires frequent recalculation of distances** to find the nearest request.

#### Use Cases:

- Suitable for workloads with scattered requests where minimizing seek time is crucial.
- Not ideal for systems where fairness or avoiding starvation is critical.

Modern systems often use algorithms like **SCAN** or **LOOK** to balance efficiency and fairness.
