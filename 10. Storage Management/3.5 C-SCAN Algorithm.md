### **C-SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm**

#### Definition:
The **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)** algorithm is a variation of the SCAN algorithm. It provides more uniform wait times by treating the disk as a circular list that wraps around. The disk head services requests in one direction only (e.g., outward), and when it reaches the end of the disk, it immediately jumps to the beginning and resumes servicing in the same direction.

---

#### How C-SCAN Works:
1. The disk head moves in a single direction (e.g., outward toward higher tracks).
2. It services all requests in that direction.
3. When the disk head reaches the last track (or the highest requested track), it jumps to the opposite end (track 0) without servicing any requests during the jump.
4. The process repeats as the disk head continues servicing requests in the same direction.

#### Example:

Suppose the disk has tracks numbered from **0 to 199**, and the disk head starts at track **53**, moving outward (towards higher tracks). The requests in the queue are: **37, 14, 65, 67, 98, 122, 183**.

1. The head moves outward and services requests: **65, 67, 98, 122, 183**.
2. Upon reaching the highest track (**199**), the head jumps to the lowest track (**0**) without servicing any requests during the jump.
3. Moving outward again, it services the remaining requests: **14, 37**.

#### Key Characteristics:
- The head always moves in one direction to service requests.
- It ensures requests are serviced in a cyclic manner.
- The jump from the last track to the first track is instantaneous and does not service requests during the jump.

---

#### Advantages:
- **Fair Wait Times**: C-SCAN provides uniform wait times by treating all requests equally, regardless of their position.
- **Prevents Starvation**: Since it continuously loops through all tracks, every request gets serviced eventually.
- **Efficiency**: The unidirectional movement reduces repeated passes over the same requests.

---

#### Disadvantages:
- **Idle Movement**: The head may jump from the last track to the first without servicing any requests, leading to overhead.
- **Complexity**: Requires a mechanism to identify the jump point and wrap around efficiently.
- **Higher Seek Time in Certain Cases**: If many requests are at the start of the disk, they will only be serviced after a full outward pass and a jump back.

#### Comparison with SCAN:
- Unlike SCAN, which reverses direction at the end, C-SCAN treats the disk as circular and always moves in the same direction.
- This approach avoids the issue of longer wait times for requests near the starting point when the disk head reverses direction.

C-SCAN is particularly suitable for systems where fairness and predictable service times are critical.
