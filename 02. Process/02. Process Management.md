## Process Management
**Process management is a crucial function of an operating system that involves creating, scheduling, terminating, prioritizing processes and many more.**

The operating system **uses a number of methods to prevent deadlocks, facilitate inter-process communication, and synchronize processes.**

**Efficient resource allocation, conflict-free process execution, and optimal system performance are all guaranteed by competent process management.** This essential component of an operating system enables the execution of numerous applications at once, enhancing system utilization and responsiveness.


## How Does a Process Look Like in Memory?

 - **Text Section:** Also known as the code segment, this section contains the executable [[Instructions]] of the program represented by the value of the [[Program Counter]]. This is where the actual code that the CPU executes is stored.
 - **Stack:** The stack is used for temporary storage during the execution of a process. It holds function parameters, [[Return Address | return addresses]], return values and local variables.
 - **Data Section:** Also known as the data segment, this section contains global and static variables that are initialized by the programmer.
 - **Heap:** The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory on the heap is allocated and deallocated as needed during the execution of the process using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `free` (in C), or `new`, `delete` (in C++).



## Characteristics of a Process

A process has the following attributes.

- **Process Id:** A unique identifier assigned by the operating system.
- **Process State:** Can be ready, running, etc.
- **CPU Registers:** Like the Program Counter (CPU registers must be saved and restored when a process is swapped in and out of the CPU)
- **Accounts Information:** Amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID, etc.
- **I/O Status Information:** For example, devices allocated to the process, open files, etc
- **CPU Scheduling Information:** For example, Priority (Different processes may have different priorities, for example, a shorter process assigned high priority in the shortest job first scheduling)



## Process Control Block (PCB)

**The Process Control Block (PCB) is a critical data structure used by the operating system to manage information about each process**. It acts as a **repository for all the data that is required to manage and track a process** during its lifecycle. Whenever the state of a process changes, the information in its PCB is updated accordingly.

### Components of the Process Control Block

1. **Pointer**: It's a stack pointer which is a register that points to the top of the current stack in memory. During a context switch, the current stack pointer value is saved in the PCB to retain the process's current execution state. When the process is rescheduled, this value is restored so the process can resume execution from the exact point it was interrupted.

2. **Process State**: Indicates the current state of the process i.e. New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated. 

3. **Process Number** (Process ID or PID): A unique identifier assigned to each process. Used by the operating system to keep track of each process and manage process-specific resources and operations.

4. **Program Counter**: **Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed** for the process. Ensures that the process can resume execution from the correct instruction after being interrupted or switched out.
   - Instruction to be executed is fetched from the address in PC ---> PC++ (PC increments to the next instruction to be executed) ---> Execute the instruction which was fetched 
     ---> Cycle continues.

5. **Register**: CPU registers that hold process-specific data. **When a process's time slice expires, the current values of its registers are saved in the PCB**. **When the process is rescheduled, these values are restored to the CPU registers**, ensuring that the process continues execution correctly.
   - Time expires for a process ---> Values in the CPU register is stored in the PCB registers ---> CPU is freed for other processes ---> The process gets rescheduled ---> The register value from the PCB is restored to the CPU registers and process starts from where it was paused.  

6. **Memory Limits**: Information about the memory management system used by the operating system for the process. This may include page tables, segment tables, etc.

7. **List of Open files**: Information about the files currently opened by the process. Helps manage file I/O operations, ensuring that the process has access to the correct files and maintaining the status of these files.
