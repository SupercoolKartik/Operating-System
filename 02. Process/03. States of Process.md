## States of Process

A process is in one of the following states: 

- **New:** Newly Created Process (or) being-created process. (After the process is created from a program)
- **Ready:** After the creation process moves to the Ready state, i.e. the process is ready for execution (waiting for the CPU to become available).
- **Running:** Currently running process in CPU (only one process at a time can be under execution in a single processor).
- **Wait (or Block):** When a process requests I/O access.
- **Terminated (or Completed):** The process completed its execution.
- **Suspended Ready:** When the ready queue (the queue of processes that are ready to be executed by the CPU) becomes full, some processes are moved to a suspended ready state. A process in the suspended ready state can be moved back to the ready state when space becomes available in the ready queue.
- **Suspended Block:** When the waiting queue becomes full. When a process is in the waiting (or blocked) state and the waiting queue (the queue of processes waiting for I/O operations or other resources) becomes full, it is moved to a suspended block state. A process in the suspended block state can be moved back to the waiting state when space becomes available in the waiting queue.

### Swapping
Swapping is a memory management technique used by operating systems to manage the limited physical memory available for processes. It involves moving processes between the main memory (RAM) and a secondary storage (usually a hard disk) to ensure that the CPU has a sufficient number of processes to execute, thereby optimizing resource utilization and system performance.

#### Swapping Process: 

1. **Swapping Out:**
    - The operating system selects a process that is either in the ready or blocked state.
    - The process's current state and memory contents are saved to secondary storage (swap space or disk).
    - The process state is changed to "suspended," and the process is moved to the suspended queue.

2. **Swapping In:**
    - When the operating system determines that the process needs to be brought back into memory (due to availability of memory or high priority), it is loaded back into RAM.
    - The process's state and memory contents are restored from secondary storage.
    - The process state is changed from "suspended" to "ready" or "blocked" based on its previous state.

**Process State Transition:**
- When a process is swapped out of memory, it transitions from the "ready" or "blocked" state to a "suspended ready" or "suspended blocked" state respectively.
- When a process is swapped back into memory, it transitions from the "suspended ready" or "suspended blocked" state back to the "ready" or "blocked" state respectively.

### Schedulers
Schedulers are crucial components of an operating system that **manage the execution of processes by determining the order in which processes run**. 

#### Types of Schedulers
There are three primary types of schedulers:

- **Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler):** **Decides which jobs or processes should be made to stay in the ready state**. This decides the degree of multiprogramming (the number of processes in memory). Once a decision is taken **it lasts for a long time** which also indicates that it **runs infrequently**. Hence it is called a long-term scheduler.

- **Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler):** Short-term scheduler will **decide which process is to be executed next** and then it will call the [[Dispatcher]]. A dispatcher is a software that moves the process from ready to run and vice versa. In other words, it is context switching. **It runs frequently** (milliseconds). Typically runs during every process switch.

- **Medium Scheduler:** Suspension decision is taken by the medium-term scheduler. The medium-term scheduler is used for [swapping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swapping-in-operating-system/) which is moving the process from main memory to secondary and vice versa. The swapping is done to reduce degree of multiprogramming.
