## Orphan Process
An orphan process is **a process whose parent process has terminated but it is still running**, leaving it without a supervising parent.

**Handling Orphan Processes:**
In Unix-like systems, orphan processes are adopted by the `init` process (process ID 1), which ensures that they are properly managed and cleaned up after they finish execution. This mechanism helps maintain system stability and efficient resource utilization.

## Zombie Process
A zombie process (also known as a defunct process) is **a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table**. This entry is retained to allow the parent process to read the child's exit status. A zombie process **does not consume any resources** like CPU or memory, **but it does occupy a slot in the process table**.

###### How Zombie Processes Occur:
- **Child Process Termination:**
    - When a child process terminates, it sends a `SIGCHLD` signal to its parent process.
- **Parent Process Inaction:**
    - If the parent process does not call `wait()` or `waitpid()` to read the exit status of the child process, the child process remains in the process table as a zombie. 
      ( When a child process terminates, the parent process must call `wait()` or `waitpid()` to read the child's exit status and remove the child's entry from the process table. This action prevents the child process from becoming a zombie, ensuring efficient resource management and system stability. These system calls are essential for handling process termination and maintaining a clean process environment.)
