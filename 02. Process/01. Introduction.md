## Process
**A process is a program in execution**. For example, **when we write a program** in C or C++ and compile it, **the compiler creates binary code**. The original code and binary code are both programs. **When we actually run the binary code, it becomes a process.** **A process is an ‘active’ entity** instead of **a program, which is considered a ‘passive’ entity.** 
A single program can create many processes when run multiple times; for example, when we open a .exe or binary file multiple times, multiple instances begin (multiple processes are created).

==PS:== When you start an application like Chrome, MS Word, the operating system creates a process for it. This process includes all the resources needed to run the application, such as memory, CPU time, and access to input/output devices.
- **Application:** A program.
- **Process:** When you open/run an application, it becomes a process. The operating system creates a process to manage the application's execution.
