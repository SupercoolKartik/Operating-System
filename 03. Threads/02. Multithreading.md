### What is Multi-Threading?

**Multithreading is a feature in operating systems that allows a program to do several tasks at the same time.**
A thread is also known as a lightweight process. **The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads.** 
For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below.

Multithreading is a technique used in operating systems to improve the performance and responsiveness of computer systems. Multithreading allows multiple threads (i.e., lightweight processes) to share the same resources of a single process, such as the CPU, [[Memory]], and [[Input Output Devices | I/O devices]].
