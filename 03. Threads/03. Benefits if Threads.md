### Benefits of Thread in Operating System

- **Responsiveness**: If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its output can be immediately returned.
- **Faster context switch**: Context switch time between threads is lower compared to the process context switch. Process context switching requires more overhead from the CPU. 
- **Effective utilization of multiprocessor system**: If we have multiple threads in a single process, then we can schedule multiple threads on multiple processors. This will make process execution faster. 
- **Resource sharing**: Resources like code, data, and files can be shared among all threads within a process. Note: Stacks and registers can’t be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers. 
- **Communication** Communication between multiple threads is easier, as the threads share a common address space. while in the process we have to follow some specific communication techniques for communication between the two processes. 
- **Enhanced throughput of the system** If a process is divided into multiple threads, and each thread function is considered as one job, then the number of jobs completed per unit of time is increased, thus increasing the throughput of the system.
