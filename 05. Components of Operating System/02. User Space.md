### User Space
The term **user space** (or **userland**) refers to all code that runs outside the operating system's kernel.
**User Space** is a critical component of an operating system that allows users to run applications and interact with the system without directly accessing the low-level hardware and system resources. It's less privileged than the kernel and **cannot directly access hardware resources**. To interact with hardware, user space programs must make system calls to the kernel.
