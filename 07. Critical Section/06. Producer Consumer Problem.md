The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization issue in operating systems. It involves two types of processes: producers, which generate data, and consumers, which process that data. Both share a common buffer. The challenge is to ensure that the producer doesn’t add data to a full buffer and the consumer doesn’t remove data from an empty buffer while avoiding conflicts when accessing the buffer.

We have a buffer of fixed size.
A producer can produce an item and can place it in the buffer.
A consumer can pick items and consume them.
**We need to ensure that when a producer is placing an item in the buffer, then at the same time consumer should not consume any item.** In this problem, the buffer is the critical section.
