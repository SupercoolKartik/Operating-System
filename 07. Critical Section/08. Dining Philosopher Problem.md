The Dining Philosopher Problem states that **N philosophers are seated around a circular table** with **one chopstick between each pair of philosophers**. **A philosopher may eat if he can pick up the two chopsticks adjacent to him**. One chopstick can only be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.

#### Problem Definition:
- **Scenario**: `N` philosophers are seated around a circular table, each needing a pair of chopsticks to eat. Each philosopher requires two chopsticks—one from their left and one from their right.
- **Resources**: There are `N` chopsticks, one between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

#### Challenges:
- **Starvation**: If the algorithm doesn’t ensure fair access to chopsticks, some philosophers might starve and never get to eat.
- **Deadlock**: If every philosopher picks up the chopstick to their left simultaneously and waits for the chopstick to their right, they may end up in a deadlock situation where everyone is waiting indefinitely.
