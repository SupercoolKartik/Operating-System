The dining philosopher's problem is the **classical problem of synchronization** which says that **N number of philosophers are sitting around a circular table** and **their job is to think and eat alternatively**. **A bowl of noodles is placed at the center of the table along with five chopsticks for each of the philosophers**. **To eat a philosopher needs both their right and a left chopstick**. A philosopher **can only eat if both immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher is available**. In case **if both** immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher are **not available then the philosopher puts down** their (either left or right) **chopstick and starts thinking again**.

The dining philosopher demonstrates a large class of concurrency control problems hence it's a classic synchronization problem.



**Dining Philosophers Problem**- Let's understand the Dining Philosophers Problem with the below code, we have used fig below as a reference to make you understand the problem exactly. The five Philosophers are represented as P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4 and five chopsticks by C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Suppose, Philosopher P0 picks up chopstick C0 and then C1. If Philosopher P1 tries to eat next, it picks up C1 but can't pick up C2 because C1 is already held by P0. This can lead to a race condition, as both philosophers are competing for the same chopstick, causing potential deadlock or resource contention.


# The solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem
We use a semaphore to represent a chopstick and this truly acts as a solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem. Wait and Signal operations will be used for the solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem, for picking a chopstick wait operation can be executed while for releasing a chopstick signal semaphore can be executed.

The structure of the chopstick is an array of a semaphore which is represented as shown below -
```
semaphore C[5];
```

Initially, each element of the semaphore C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4 are initialized to 1 as the chopsticks are on the table and not picked up by any of the philosophers.


Let's code the Dining Philosopher Problem by using semaphore operations wait and signal, the desired code looks like

```
 void Philosopher  
  {  
  while(1)  
   {  
    Wait( chopstick[i] );  
    Wait( chopstick[(i+1) % 5] ) ;  
    . .  
    . EATING THE NOODLE  
    .  
    Signal( put_chopstickC[i] );  
    Signal( put_chopstickC[ (i+1) % 5] ) ;  
    .  
    . THINKING  
   }  
 }
```

In the above code, first wait operation is performed on chopstick[i] and chopstick[ (i+1) % 5]. This shows philosopher i have picked up the chopsticks from its left and right. The eating function is performed after that.

On completion of eating by philosopher i the, signal operation is performed on chopstick[i] and chopstick[ (i+1) % 5]. This shows that the philosopher i have eaten and put down both the left and right chopsticks. Finally, the philosopher starts thinking again.

Let value of i = 0( initial value ), Suppose Philosopher P0 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute **Wait( take_chopstickC[i] );** by doing this it holds **C0 chopstick** and reduces semaphore C0 to 0, after that it execute **Wait( take_chopstickC[(i+1) % 5] );** by doing this it holds **C1 chopstick**( since i =0, therefore (0 + 1) % 5 = 1) and reduces semaphore C1 to 0

Similarly, suppose now Philosopher P1 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute **Wait( take_chopstickC[i] );** by doing this it will try to hold **C1 chopstick** but will not be able to do that, since the value of semaphore C1 has already been set to 0 by philosopher P0, therefore it will enter into an infinite loop because of which philosopher P1 will not be able to pick chopstick C1 whereas if Philosopher P2 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute **Wait( take_chopstickC[i] );** by doing this it holds **C2 chopstick** and reduces semaphore C2 to 0, after that, it executes **Wait( take_chopstickC[(i+1) % 5] );** by doing this it holds **C3 chopstick**( since i =2, therefore (2 + 1) % 5 = 3) and reduces semaphore C3 to 0.

Hence the above code is providing a solution to the dining philosopher problem, A philosopher can only eat if both immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher are available else philosopher needs to wait. Also at one go two independent philosophers can eat simultaneously (i.e., philosopher **P0 and P2, P1 and P3 & P2 and P4** can eat simultaneously as all are the independent processes and they are following the above constraint of dining philosopher problem)


#### The drawback of the above solution of the dining philosopher problem

From the above solution of the dining philosopher problem, we have proved that no two neighboring philosophers can eat at the same point in time. **The drawback of the above solution is that this solution can lead to a deadlock condition**. This situation happens if all the philosophers pick their left chopstick at the same time, which leads to the condition of deadlock and none of the philosophers can eat.


**To avoid deadlock in the Dining Philosophers Problem, some solutions include:**

1. **Limit the Number of Philosophers:** Reduce the number of philosophers to four. This ensures that at least one philosopher can always eat, as one chopstick (C4) will remain available, preventing deadlock.
    
2. **Pick Chopsticks Based on Position:** Philosophers at even positions should pick up the right chopstick first, followed by the left. Philosophers at odd positions should do the opposite. This prevents a circular wait, a common cause of deadlock.
    
3. **Only Pick Both Chopsticks Together:** A philosopher should only pick up their chopsticks if both are available at the same time. This avoids a situation where a philosopher holds one chopstick and waits indefinitely for the other.
    
4. **Asymmetrical Approach:** Philosophers P0 to P3 pick the left chopstick first, while P4 picks the right chopstick first. This strategy ensures that at least one chopstick remains free, allowing a philosopher to eat, preventing the circular wait that leads to deadlock.
