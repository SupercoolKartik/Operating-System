#### Critical Section
In computer science, a **critical section refers to a segment of code that is executed by multiple concurrent threads or processes**, **and which accesses shared resources**. These resources may include shared memory, files, or other system resources that can only be accessed by one thread or process at a time to avoid data inconsistency or race conditions.

**Note:** The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section.

## Race Condition
A race condition occurs when multiple processes or threads access shared resources concurrently, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results. Proper synchronization mechanisms must be in place to avoid race conditions.

In concurrent programming, if one thread tries to change the value of shared data at the same time as another thread tries to read the value (i.e., data race across threads), the result is unpredictable. The access to such shared variables (shared memory, shared files, shared port, etc.) is to be synchronized.


## Components of the Critical Section Problem

1. **Entry Section:** The code that requests entry to the critical section. The process or thread must acquire a lock or some form of permission before entering the critical section.

2. **Critical Section:** The section of code where the shared resource is accessed. Only one process or thread is allowed to execute this section at a time.

3. **Exit Section:** The code that runs after the critical section, releasing the lock or permission, allowing other processes or threads to enter the critical section.

4. **Remainder Section:** The rest of the code outside the critical section that does not involve accessing the shared resource.



## Requirements of Synchronization mechanisms

##### Primary

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Our solution must provide mutual exclusion. By Mutual Exclusion, we mean that if one process is executing inside critical section then the other process must not enter in the critical section.

2. **Progress**: Progress means that if one process doesn't need to execute into critical section then it should not stop other processes to get into the critical section.

##### Secondary

1. **Bounded Waiting**: We should be able to predict the waiting time for every process to get into the critical section. The process must not be endlessly waiting for getting into the critical section.

3. **Architectural Neutrality (Portability)**: Our mechanism must be architectural natural. It means that if our solution is working fine on one architecture then it should also run on the other ones as well.
