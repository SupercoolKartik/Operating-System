The **Readers-Writers Problem is a classic synchronization problem** in computer science, which **illustrates the challenges of managing access to a shared resource in a concurrent system**. 
The problem involves processes that can either read or write to a shared resource, such as a database or a file. The **goal is to design a system** that **allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously**, but ensures that **only one writer can modify** the resource at any given time, **with no readers accessing it during a write operation**.


### Variants of the Problem
There are two common variants of the Readers-Writers Problem:

1. **First Readers-Writers Problem (Readers-Preference):**
    - In this version, **no reader should be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained permission to use the resource**.
    - Writers may starve (i.e., they may never get a chance to write) if there is a continuous stream of readers.


**There are four types of cases that could happen here:**

| **Case** | **Process 1** | **Process 2** | **Allowed/Not Allowed** |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Case 1   | Writing       | Writing       | Not Allowed             |
| Case 2   | Writing       | Reading       | Not Allowed             |
| Case 3   | Reading       | Writing       | Not Allowed             |
| Case 4   | Reading       | Reading       | Allowed                 |


2. **Second Readers-Writers Problem (Writers-Preference):**
    - In this version, **once a writer is ready, it should be given priority over subsequent readers to avoid writer starvation**.
    - Readers may starve if there are continuous requests from writers.


# Solution for Readers-Writers Problem
A typical solution involves using synchronization primitives such as semaphores or mutexes to manage access to the shared resource.

##### Pseudocode (Readers-Preference)
```
// SHARED VARIABLES

int read_count = 0;      // Number of readers currently accessing the resource
semaphore mutex = 1;     // Binary semaphore for synchronizing access to                                    read_count 
semaphore wrt = 1;       // Semaphore to control access to the shared resource
```

```
// READER PROCESS

Reader() {
    wait(mutex);        // Lock the mutex
    read_count++;       // Increment the number of readers
    if (read_count == 1)
        wait(wrt);      // If this is the first reader, lock the resource for                             writers
    signal(mutex);      // Unlock the mutex


    //--------- Reading the shared resource ---------
    read_shared_resource();
    //-----------------------------------------------


    wait(mutex);        // Lock the mutex
    read_count--;       // Decrement the number of readers
    if (read_count == 0)
        signal(wrt);    // If this is the last reader, unlock the resource for                            writers
    signal(mutex);      // Unlock the mutex
}
```

```
// WRITER PROCESS

Writer() {
    wait(wrt);          // Lock the resource for writers (no readers or other writers)
    
    // Writing to the shared resource
    write_shared_resource();

    signal(wrt);        // Unlock the resource
}

```
