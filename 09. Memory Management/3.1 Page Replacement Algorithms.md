In a virtual memory system, when a page fault occurs and no free page frame is available in the main memory, the operating system must replace an existing page to make room for the new page. This process is known as **page replacement**.

##### How Page Replacement works:

1. **Page Replacement Algorithm**: The system uses a page replacement algorithm (like Least Recently Used or First-In-First-Out) to decide which of the existing pages currently in memory should be replaced. The goal of the algorithm is to pick a page that is less likely to be needed again soon, to minimize future page faults.

2. **Marking the Page for Replacement**: Once a page is selected for replacement, the system marks its page table entry as “not present” in memory. This means that, if a program tries to access this page later, it will trigger a page fault, and the page will need to be loaded back into memory.

3. **Checking for Modified or [[Dirty Pages]]**: If the selected page has been modified (meaning the data in the page has changed since it was loaded into memory), the system needs to save the changes before replacing it. This is done by checking the **modified bit** (or [[Dirty Bit | dirty bit]]) in the page table entry. If the bit is set, the page is considered "dirty" and the system needs to **page out** (write the modified page back to disk) to avoid losing any data.

4. **Bringing the New Page into Memory**: After the selected page is replaced, the system brings the new page into memory and updates the page table with the new information.

This process ensures that memory space is efficiently managed while maintaining data integrity, even when all page frames are in use.

#### Common Page Replacement Techniques
- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Optimal Page replacement
- Least Recently Used
- Most Recently Used (MRU)


### First In First Out (FIFO)
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.

**Example:** Consider page reference string 1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 6, 3 with 3 page frames. Find the number of page faults.

  ![[fifo-page-replacement.png]]


Initially, all slots are empty, so when 1, 3, 0 came they are allocated to the empty slots —> 3 Page Faults.  
when 3 comes, it is already in memory so —> 0 Page Faults.
Then 5 comes, it is not available in memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e. 1. —> 1 Page Fault.
6 comes, it is also not available in memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e. 3 —> 1 Page Fault.
Finally, when 3 come it is not available so it replaces 0 —> 1 page fault.

**Note:** Belady’s anomaly proves that it is possible to have more page faults when increasing the number of page frames while using the page replacement algorithm.  For example, if we consider reference strings 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, and 3 slots, we get 9 total page faults, but if we increase slots to 4, we get 10-page faults.


### Optimal Page Replacement

In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.

**Example:** Consider the page references 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3 with 4 page frame. Find number of page fault.

   ![[optimal-page-replacement.png]]
Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults
0 is already there so —> 0 Page fault 
when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is not used for the longest duration of time in the future.—> 1 Page fault.
0 is already there so —> 0 Page fault.
4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault.
Now for the further page reference string —> 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory.

**Optimal page replacement is perfect, but not possible** in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests. The **use of Optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark** so that other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it.


### Least Recently Used

In this algorithm, page will be replaced which is least recently used.

**Example:** Consider the page reference string 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3 with 4 page frames. Find number of page faults.

   ![[lru-page-replacement.png]]

Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults
0 is already their so —> 0 Page fault 
when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is least recently used —> 1 Page fault 
0 is already in memory so —> 0 Page fault 
4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault
Now for the further page reference string —> 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory.

### Most Recently Used (MRU)

In this algorithm, page will be replaced which has been used recently. Belady’s anomaly can occur in this algorithm.


   ![[mru-page-replacement.png]]

Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults
0 is already their so–> 0 page fault
when 3 comes it will take place of 0 because it is most recently used —> 1 Page fault
when 0 comes it will take place of 3  —> 1 Page fault
when 4 comes it will take place of 0  —> 1 Page fault
2 is already in memory so —> 0 Page fault
when 3 comes it will take place of 2  —> 1 Page fault
when 0 comes it will take place of 3  —> 1 Page fault
when 3 comes it will take place of 0  —> 1 Page fault
when 2 comes it will take place of 3  —> 1 Page fault
when 3 comes it will take place of 2  —> 1 Page fault


#### Conclusion
In summary, page replacement algorithms are essential for managing a computer’s memory efficiently. They help ensure that the system runs smoothly by reducing the number of times it needs to fetch data from slower storage. Different algorithms, like FIFO and [LRU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/) , have their own pros and cons, and choosing the right one depends on the specific needs of the system. Understanding these algorithms can help improve system performance and make our computers faster and more efficient.
