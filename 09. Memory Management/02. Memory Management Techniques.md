Contiguous memory management is a memory allocation technique where each process is allocated a single continuous block of memory based on the process's size. This means that a process's entire memory needs are placed in one uninterrupted section of physical memory.

**Contiguous Memory Management has two types:**
- Fixed(or Static) Partition
- Variable(or Dynamic) Partitioning

#### 1.1 Fixed Partition (Static Partition)
Fixed partitioning is a memory management technique where the main memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions or blocks. Each partition can hold exactly one process. The size of the partitions is determined at the time of system initialization and remains constant throughout the system's operation. When a process is loaded into memory, it is placed in one of the partitions that is large enough to accommodate it.

###### There are various cons of using this technique.

**1. Internal Fragmentation**
If the size of the process is lesser then the total size of the partition then some size of the partition get wasted and remain unused. This is wastage of the memory and called internal fragmentation.
As shown in the image below, the 4 MB partition is used to load only 3 MB process and the remaining 1 MB got wasted.

**2. External Fragmentation**
The total unused space of various partitions cannot be used to load the processes even though there is space available but not in the contiguous form.
As shown in the image below, the remaining 1 MB space of each partition cannot be used as a unit to store a 4 MB process. Despite of the fact that the sufficient space is available to load the process, process will not be loaded.

**3. Limitation on the size of the process**
If the process size is larger than the size of maximum sized partition then that process cannot be loaded into the memory. Therefore, a limitation can be imposed on the process size that is it cannot be larger than the size of the largest partition.

**4. Degree of multiprogramming is less**
By Degree of multi programming, we simply mean the maximum number of processes that can be loaded into the memory at the same time. In fixed partitioning, the degree of multiprogramming is fixed and very less due to the fact that the size of the partition cannot be varied according to the size of processes.
