Virtual Memory is a storage scheme that provides user an illusion of having a very big main memory. This is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory.

In this scheme, User can load the bigger size processes than the available main memory by having the illusion that the memory is available to load the process.

Instead of loading one big process in the main memory, the Operating System loads the different parts of more than one process in the main memory.

By doing this, the degree of multiprogramming will be increased and therefore, the CPU utilization will also be increased.


### How Virtual Memory Works?

1. **Memory Translation**: Virtual memory translates virtual addresses (used by programs) to physical addresses (in RAM).
2. **Dynamic Address Translation**: A process can be swapped in and out of memory, and it doesn’t need to occupy continuous memory locations. This is possible through **dynamic run-time address translation**.
3. **Paged or Segmented**: Virtual memory uses paging or segmentation to load only the needed parts of a process into memory. It brings in parts of a process on demand, based on what’s required at that moment.


### Types of Virtual Memory:

#### 1. Paging:

- Memory is divided into small fixed-size blocks called **pages**.
- When RAM is full, pages that aren’t in use are moved to the hard drive (swap space). If needed again, they are swapped back into RAM.

- **Demand Paging**: Pages are only loaded into memory when they are needed, which helps reduce memory usage. When a page not in memory is needed, a age fault occurs, and the system fetches it from disk.
    
- **Page Fault Handling Steps**:
    1. CPU tries to access a page not in memory (causes a **page fault**).
    2. The operating system blocks the process.
    3. The OS finds the needed page in the logical address space.
    4. The page is brought into physical memory using page replacement algorithms.
    5. The page table is updated.
    6. The process is resumed and the program continues.
       
- **Page Fault Service Time**:
    - The time to service/handle a page fault.
    - **Effective memory access time**:

```
 Formula: (p * s) + ((1 - p) * m), where:
    p = page fault rate
    s = page fault service time
    m = main memory access time                  
```

#### 2.Segmentation
   
- Memory is divided into **segments** of varying sizes instead of fixed-sized pages.
- Segments that aren’t needed are moved to the hard drive.
- A **segment table** tracks each segment’s status and memory location.



#### Combining Paging and Segmentation:
- Sometimes, both paging and segmentation are combined.
- Memory is divided into pages, and segments consist of multiple pages. The virtual address contains both a **segment number** and a **page number** to manage memory more efficiently.

### Advantages:
- **Allows running larger programs than the available RAM**.
- **Improves multitasking** by allowing multiple programs to share memory.
- **Efficient memory use** since only the required portions of programs are kept in RAM.
  
### Disadvantages:
- **Page Faults**: Frequent page faults can slow down the system.
- **Slower Access**: Accessing data from the hard drive is much slower than RAM.
- Adds **overhead** to the system as it manages virtual and physical memory translation.
