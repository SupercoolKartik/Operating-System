**Operating System** is a system software. It manages all the resources of the computer, both hardware and software resources and operations of the computer. An operating system acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.

Operating System is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and other system software of the computer. 
**Examples** of Operating Systems are **Windows**, **Linux**, **Mac OS**, etc.

The operating System comes with a large number of device drivers that make OS services reachable to the hardware environment.
Each and every application present in the system requires the Operating System.
The operating system works as a communication channel between system hardware and system software.
The operating system helps an application with the hardware part without knowing about the actual hardware configuration.
It is one of the most important parts of the system and hence it is present in every device, whether large or small device.

## Functions of the Operating System
- **Resource Management:** The operating system manages and allocates memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources among the various programs and processes running on the computer.
- **Process Management:** The operating system is responsible for starting, stopping, and managing processes and programs. It also controls the scheduling of processes and allocates resources to them.
- **Memory Management:** The operating system manages the computer’s primary memory and provides mechanisms for optimizing memory usage.
- **Security:** The operating system provides a secure environment for the user, applications, and data by implementing security policies and mechanisms such as access controls and encryption.
- **File Management:** The operating system is responsible for organizing and managing the file system, including the creation, deletion, and manipulation of files and directories.
- **User Interface:** The operating system provides a user interface that enables users to interact with the computer system. This can be a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
