### **C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm**

#### Definition:
The **C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)** algorithm is a variation of the LOOK algorithm. It optimizes disk scheduling by only servicing requests between the minimum and maximum requested tracks, moving in one direction. When the head reaches the last requested track in its current direction, it jumps directly to the first requested track and resumes servicing in the same direction.

---

#### How C-LOOK Works:
1. The disk head moves in one direction (e.g., outward toward higher tracks), servicing all requests in that range.
2. When it reaches the last request in that direction, it **jumps directly** to the first request in the queue in the opposite direction.
3. The process repeats, always moving in one direction within the requested range.

#### Example:

Suppose the disk has tracks numbered **0 to 199**, and the disk head starts at **53**, moving outward. The request queue is: **14, 37, 65, 67, 98, 122, 183**.

1. **Initial Movement**: The head moves outward, servicing: **65, 67, 98, 122, 183**.
2. **Jump Back**: The head jumps directly to **14**, the lowest request, skipping any unnecessary movement to track 0.
3. **Second Pass**: The head resumes moving outward, servicing: **14, 37**.

#### Key Characteristics:
- The disk head only moves within the range of requested tracks.
- It avoids servicing non-requested tracks, minimizing unnecessary movement.
- The jump from the last requested track to the first requested track is direct, skipping any tracks in between.

---

#### Advantages:
- **Efficient Movement**: By skipping unnecessary tracks, it reduces seek time compared to C-SCAN.
- **Fair Service**: Like C-SCAN, it provides fair wait times by treating all requests equally.
- **Reduced Latency**: Servicing only the requested range eliminates wasted time on non-requested tracks.

---

#### Disadvantages:
- **Idle Jump**: The jump from the last request to the first introduces overhead.
- **Complexity**: Slightly more complex to implement than LOOK, as it requires identifying the boundaries of the requested range.
- **Non-Continuous Movement**: May appear less intuitive due to the abrupt jumps.

---

#### Comparison with LOOK and C-SCAN:
- **LOOK** reverses direction at the end of the requested range, whereas **C-LOOK** jumps directly to the other end.
- **C-LOOK** avoids traversing tracks outside the requested range, unlike C-SCAN, which always moves across the full disk.
- Offers better performance in terms of seek time compared to C-SCAN when requests are clustered.

C-LOOK is an effective algorithm for environments with clustered requests, optimizing disk access while ensuring fairness and efficiency.
