There are several types of Operating Systems in which many of which are mentioned below. Let’s have a look at them.

- Batch Operating System
- Multi-Programming Operating System
- Multi-Processing Operating System
- Multi-Tasking Operating System
- Time-Sharing Operating System
- Distributed Operating System
- Network Operating System
- Real-Time Operating System

## 1. Batch Operating System
This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. **There is an operator** which **takes similar jobs** having the same requirement and **groups them into batches.** It is the responsibility of the operator to sort jobs with similar needs.

Users do not interact directly with the computer. Instead, users prepare their jobs on an offline device like a punch card and submit them to the computer operator. Jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group.

#### Advantages of Batch Operating System
- **Multiple users can share the batch systems:** Allows multiple users to share system resources efficiently, as the system can prioritize and schedule jobs based on available resources.
- **The idle time for the batch system is very less:** Batches jobs to be processed in groups, optimizing the use of system resources and reducing idle time.
- **Reduced Setup Time:**  Processes multiple jobs in a single batch, reducing the [[Overhead]] associated with setting up jobs individually.
- **Cost-Effective for Large Tasks:** Ideal for processing large volumes of similar tasks, which can be executed in sequence without manual intervention.

#### Disadvantages of Batch Operating System
- **Lack of Interactivity:** Users cannot interact with their jobs once they are submitted, which can be inconvenient if changes or corrections are needed.
- **Batch systems are hard to debug:** Identifying and fixing errors can be difficult, as the jobs are processed in batches and errors may not be detected until after the entire batch is executed.
- **Delayed Output:** Jobs may not be processed immediately, leading to delays in getting the output, especially if the queue is long. The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.


## 2. Multi-Programming Operating System
**Multi-programming Operating Systems** **allow multiple programs to run at the same time** by **keeping several programs in the computer’s memory**. The operating system manages these programs and **switches the CPU’s attention between them**.

When one program needs to wait for something slow or going I/O, like reading from a disk, the CPU quickly switches to another program which is called Context Switching. This way, the CPU is always busy doing work instead of sitting idle. This makes the computer work more efficiently and get more tasks done in a shorter amount of time

#### Advantages of Multi-Programing Operating System
- **Improved Resource Utilization:** Efficiently manages system resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) by sharing them among multiple jobs.
- **Better System Throughput:** Allows more jobs to be completed in a given time frame, improving overall [[Throughput]] and system performance.
- **Reduced Job Waiting Time:** Jobs spend less time waiting in the queue, as the CPU can quickly switch to another job when one is waiting for I/O operations.

#### Disadvantages of Multi-Programing Operating System
- **No Direct User Interaction:** Users cannot interact with system resources directly while programs are running. Multi-programming systems are designed to maximize CPU utilization, not for interactive use, which can be limiting for certain applications requiring immediate user feedback.
- **Complexity in Management:** Requires sophisticated memory management and scheduling algorithms, increasing system complexity.
- **Overhead in Context Switching:** Frequent context switching can lead to significant overhead, as saving and loading job states consume CPU cycles.


## 3. Multi-Processing Operating System
Multi-Processing Operating System is a type of Operating System in which more than one CPU(processor) is used for the execution of resources. It betters the throughput of the System.

#### Advantages of Multi-Processing Operating System
- **Increased Throughput:** The system can handle more processes and users simultaneously, leading to increased throughput.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** As it has several processors, so, if one processor fails, we can proceed with another processor.
- **Resource Utilization:** Reduced idle time for processors as tasks are distributed and managed effectively.

#### Disadvantages of Multi-Processing Operating System
- **Complexity:** Due to the multiple CPU, it can be more complex and somehow difficult to understand.
- **Heat and Power Consumption:** Multiple processors generate more heat, necessitating advanced cooling solutions.

## 4. Multi-Tasking Operating System
A multi-tasking operating system (OS) is **designed to handle multiple tasks or processes simultaneously**, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of the system. In a multi-tasking environment, the **CPU can switch between different tasks, giving the impression that they are running concurrently**.

#### Advantages of Multi-Tasking Operating System
- **Simultaneous Execution of Multiple Programs:** Multiple programs can run at the same time, allowing users to perform various tasks concurrently. For example, you can browse the internet, listen to music, and work on a document simultaneously.
- **Improved Utilization of CPU:** Ensures the CPU is always doing useful work, reducing idle time.
- **Responsiveness:** Allows multiple applications to run simultaneously, improving user experience.

#### Disadvantages of Multi-Tasking Operating System
- **Heat Generation:** The system gets heated in case of heavy programs multiple times.
- **Increased Complexity:** Multi-tasking operating systems are inherently more complex than single-tasking systems. This complexity arises from the need to manage multiple processes, handle resource allocation, and ensure synchronization between tasks.


## 5. Time-Sharing Operating System
**Each task is given some time to execute** so that all the tasks work smoothly **allowing multiple users to interact with a computer simultaneously**. Each user gets the time of the CPU as they use a single system which creates the illusion that they have their own dedicated computer. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from a single user or different users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. **After this time interval is over OS switches over to the next task.**

#### Advantages of Time-Sharing Operating System
- **Each task gets an equal opportunity**.
- **CPU idle time can be reduced**.
- **Resource Sharing:** Time-sharing systems allow multiple users to share hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals, reducing the cost of hardware and increasing efficiency.
- **Improved Productivity:** Time-sharing allows users to work concurrently, thereby reducing the waiting time for their turn to use the computer. This increased productivity translates to more work getting done in less time.

#### Disadvantages of Time-Sharing Operating System
- **Complexity:** Time-sharing systems are complex and require advanced software to manage multiple users simultaneously. This complexity increases the chance of bugs and errors.
- **Security Risks:** Sharing resources among multiple users increases the risk of security breaches. Time-sharing systems require careful management of user access, authentication, and authorization to ensure the security of data and software.
- **Overhead:** Frequent context switching introduces overhead, which can impact system performance. The overhead includes saving and restoring the state of processes.


## 6. Distributed Operating System
A **Distributed Operating System (DOS)** is an advanced type of operating system that manages a collection of independent computers and makes them appear to the users as a single coherent system. These computers, often referred to as nodes, can be physically located in different places but are connected via a network. Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred to as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. These systems’ processors differ in size and function.

The major benefit of working with these types of the operating system is that it is always possible that one user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but some other system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network.

#### Advantages of Distributed Operating System
- **Fault-Tolerance:** Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent of each other.
- **Performance:** Distributing tasks across multiple nodes can lead to faster processing and improved performance.
- **Load on host computer reduces.**
- **Scalability:** These systems are easily scalable as many systems can be easily added to the network.

#### Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System
- **Complexity:** Managing a distributed system is more complex than managing a single system due to issues like synchronization, data consistency, and network communication.
- **Security:** Ensuring security across multiple nodes can be challenging due to potential vulnerabilities in network communication.
- **Network Dependence:** The system relies on network connectivity. Network failures or latency can impact performance.
- These types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive. Not only that the underlying software is highly complex and not understood well yet.

## 7. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

These types of OSs serve [[Real-Time Systems]]. The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time interval is called response time. Real-time systems are used when there are time requirements that are very strict like missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots, etc.

### Types of Real-Time Operating Systems
- **Hard Real-Time Systems:** Hard Real-Time OSs are meant for applications where time constraints are very strict and even the shortest possible delay is not acceptable. These systems are built for saving life like automatic parachutes or airbags which are required to be readily available in case of an accident. Virtual memory is rarely found in these systems.
- **Soft Real-Time Systems:** These OSs are for applications where time-constraint is less strict.

#### Advantages of Real-Time Operating System
- **Maximum Consumption:** Maximum utilization of devices and systems, thus more output from all the resources.
- **Task Shifting:** The time assigned for shifting tasks in these systems is very less. For example, in older systems, it takes about 10 microseconds in shifting from one task to another, and in the latest systems, it takes 3 microseconds.
- **Error Free:** These types of systems are error-free.
- **Focus on Application:** Focus on running applications and less importance on applications that are in the queue.
- **Real-time operating system in the embedded system:** Since the size of programs is small, RTOS can also be used in embedded systems like in transport and others.

#### Disadvantages of Real-Time Operating System
- **Limited Tasks:** Very few tasks run at the same time and their concentration is very less on a few applications to avoid errors.
- **Use heavy system resources:** Sometimes the system resources are not so good and they are expensive as well.
- **Complex Algorithms:** The algorithms are very complex and difficult for the designer to write on.
