**System calls are the mechanism by which user-level processes request services from the operating system's kernel.** They **provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system**, **allowing user programs to interact with the hardware** and perform tasks such as file manipulation, process control, and communication.

**How it works:**
When a user process makes a system call, it triggers a context switch from user mode to kernel mode, allowing the kernel to execute the requested operation. Once the operation is complete, control returns to the user mode.

System calls are essential for the proper functioning of an operating system, as they provide a standardized way for programs to access system resources. Without system calls, each program would need to implement its methods for accessing hardware and system services, leading to inconsistent and error-prone behavior.
