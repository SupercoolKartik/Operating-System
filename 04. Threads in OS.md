**A thread is a single sequence stream within a process.** 
( When we say that a thread is a single sequence stream within a process, it means that the thread follows a linear, ordered series of instructions or steps, executed one after the other. )

Threads are sometimes referred to as lightweight processes because they share many of the same resources as the parent process but are independently schedulable units.

Each thread belongs to exactly one process. In an operating system that supports multithreading, the process can consist of many threads.Â But threads can be effective only if the CPU is more than 1 otherwise two threads have to context switch for that single CPU.

#### Why Do We Need Thread?
- Threads run in parallel improving the application performance. Each such thread has its own CPU state and stack, but they share the address space of the process and the environment.
- Like the processes, threads also have states like ready, executing, blocked, etc.
- Priority can be assigned to the threads just like the process, and the highest priority thread is scheduled first.
