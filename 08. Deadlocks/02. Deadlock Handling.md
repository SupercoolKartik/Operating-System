## Methods for Handling Deadlocks

There are three ways to handle deadlock
- Deadlock Ignorance
- Deadlock Prevention
- Deadlock Avoidance
- Deadlock Detection and Recovery

### 1. Deadlock Ignorance
In this approach, the **Operating system assumes that deadlock never occurs**. **It simply ignores deadlock**. This approach is **best suitable for a single end user system** where User uses the system only for browsing and all other normal stuff.

**There is always a tradeoff between Correctness and performance**. The operating systems like Windows and Linux mainly focus upon performance. However, the **performance of the system decreases if it uses deadlock handling mechanism all the time if deadlock happens 1 out of 100 times then it is completely unnecessary to use the deadlock handling mechanism all the time**.

In these types of systems, **the user has to simply restart the computer in the case of deadlock**. **Windows and Linux are mainly using this approach**.


### 2. Deadlock Prevention
If we simulate deadlock with a table which is standing on its four legs then we can also simulate four legs with the four conditions which when occurs simultaneously, cause the deadlock.
However, if we break one of the legs of the table then the table will fall definitely. The same happens with deadlock, if we can be able to violate one of the four necessary conditions and don't let them occur together then we can prevent the deadlock.

##### 1. Mutual Exclusion
For some resources, like printers, mutual exclusion is necessary, and you cannot prevent it. However, for some other resources, you can modify the resource so it can be shared among processes. For example, files can be opened in read-only mode by multiple processes simultaneously.

##### 2. Hold and Wait
- **Request All Resources at Once:** One way to prevent hold and wait is to require a process to request all the resources it needs at once, before it begins execution. If all the resources are available, the process is granted them, and it proceeds. If not, the process waits until it can acquire all resources simultaneously.
  However, this sounds very practical but can't be done in the computer system because a process can't determine necessary resources initially. Process is the set of instructions which are executed by the CPU. Each of the instruction may demand multiple resources at the multiple times. The need cannot be fixed by the OS.
- **No Resource Holding:** Another method is to ensure that a process holding some resources is not allowed to request more. It must release all the resources it holds before requesting any new ones. However, this may lead to inefficient resource utilization and increased overhead due to repeated requests and releases.

##### 3. No Preemption
Deadlock arises due to the fact that a process can't be stopped once it starts. However, if we take the resource away from the process which is causing deadlock then we can prevent deadlock.

This is not a good approach at all since if we take a resource away which is being used by the process then all the work which it has done till now can become inconsistent.

Consider a printer is being used by any process. If we take the printer away from that process and assign it to some other process then all the data which has been printed can become inconsistent and ineffective and also the fact that the process can't start printing again from where it has left which causes performance inefficiency.

##### 4. Circular Wait
The **simplest and most effective method** to prevent circular wait is to impose an ordering of all resource types and require that each process requests resources in an increasing order of enumeration. For example, if a process needs resources R1, R2, and R3, it must request them in the order R1, R2, R3. This prevents circular chains of processes waiting for each other.

##### Comparison
Among all the methods, violating Circular wait is the only approach that can be implemented practically.

| Condition        | Approach                               | Is it practically possible? |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Mutual Exclusion | Spooling                               | NO                          |
| Hold and Wait    | Requesting all the resourses initially | NO                          |
| No Preemtion     | Snatch all resourses                   | NO                          |
| Circular Wait    | Order resources numerically            | YES                         |


### 2. Deadlock Avoidance

Deadlock avoidance is a **strategy where the system only grants resource requests if it can ensure that doing so will not lead to a deadlock**, either immediately or in the future. Since the **kernel cannot predict exactly how processes will behave, it takes a cautious approach** to avoid deadlocks.

**To manage this, each process must declare the maximum number of resource units it might need throughout its execution**. The **kernel then allows the process to request these resources in stages**, a few units at a time, while ensuring that the total does not exceed the declared maximum. **Before granting any request, the kernel analyzes the situation to check if it could lead to a deadlock**. If there's **any risk, the request is put on hold** until it can be safely granted. This method is conservative, as a process might not end up needing all the resources it declared, but the system still considers the worst-case scenario to prevent deadlocks.

#### Deadlock Avoidance Solution
##### 1. Recourse Allocation Graph
A Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) is a graphical representation used in operating systems to **illustrate the allocation of resources to processes and to help detect potential deadlocks**. It **also contains the information about all the instances of all the resources** whether they are available or being used by the processes. 


**The graph consists of two types of nodes:**

1. **Processes (P1, P2, ...)**
    - Represented by **Circles**.
    - Each node corresponds to a process that is currently executing or waiting for resources.   
2. **Resources (R1, R2, ...)**
    - Represented by **Rectangles**.
    - Each node corresponds to a resource type. Each resource type can have multiple instances.

**Resource can have more than one instance**. Each instance will be **represented by a dot inside the rectangle**.

**The edges in the graph represent the relationships between processes and resources:**

- **Request Edge (P1 → R1):**
    - A directed edge from a **process node to a resource node** indicates that the **process is requesting** that resource.  
- **Assignment Edge (R1 → P1):**
    - A directed edge from a **resource node to a process node** indicates that the **resource has been allocated** to that process.

##### 2. Banker's Algorithm
Banker's algorithm does the same as we explained the Deadlock avoidance with the help of an example. The algorithm predetermines whether the System will be in a safe state or not by simulating the allocation of the resources to the processes according to the maximum available resources. **It makes an "s-state" check before actually allocating the resources to the Processes**.

**When there are more number of Processes and many Resources, then Banker's Algorithm is useful.**

#### 4. Deadlock Detection and Recovery
##### Deadlock Detection
Deadlock detection is the process of determining if a deadlock has occurred in the system. Unlike deadlock prevention and avoidance, which aim to prevent deadlocks from occurring in the first place, detection allows deadlocks to occur but provides a mechanism to identify and handle them.


###### How Deadlock Detection Works

1. **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG):**
    - The system can use a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG), a cycle in this graph can indicate the presence of a deadlock (especially in systems with a single instance of each resource type).
      
2. **Wait-for Graph (WFG):**
    - This is a simplified version of the RAG used when each resource has a single instance. It shows which processes are waiting for others to release resources. A cycle in this graph indicates a deadlock.
     [[Wait-for Graph (WFG) |  more..]]
      
3. **Detection Algorithms:**
    - **For Single Instances of Resources:** The system can periodically perform a search in the RAG or WFG to detect cycles.
    - **For Multiple Instances of Resources:** The system uses more complex algorithms, like the Banker's algorithm, which considers the current allocation, the maximum needs, and the available resources to determine if a deadlock is possible.
      
4. **Periodic Checks:**
    - The operating system can periodically run these detection algorithms to identify deadlocks. The frequency of these checks depends on how critical deadlocks are in the system’s context.

##### Deadlock Recovery
**Deadlock recovery** is a process in computer science and operating systems that aims to resolve or mitigate the effects of a deadlock after it has been detected.

Once a deadlock is detected, the system must take steps to recover from it. There are several approaches to deadlock recovery:

1. **Process Termination:**
    - **Abort All Deadlocked Processes:** This is a brute-force approach where all processes involved in the deadlock are terminated. This method is straightforward but can lead to significant work loss.
    - **Abort One Process at a Time:** Another method is to terminate one process at a time until the cycle in the resource allocation graph is broken. The system may choose the process to abort based on criteria like process priority, execution time, or resource usage.
      
2. **Resource Preemption:**
    - The system can forcefully take resources away from some processes and reallocate them to others to break the deadlock. This approach is more flexible but requires careful handling to avoid issues like starvation (where a process is repeatedly denied resources).
      
3. **Rollback:** 
    - Some systems support rolling back a process to a previous safe state where it did not hold any resources. After rolling back, the system can restart the process and avoid the same sequence of operations that led to the deadlock.
      
4. **Process Priority Adjustment:**
    - The system can lower the priority of some processes involved in a deadlock, giving others a better chance to acquire the resources they need and complete their tasks.
