Deadlock is a situation in computing where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources.

Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. This is a practical example of deadlock.


### How Does Deadlock occur in the Operating System?

Before going into detail about how deadlock occurs in the Operating System, let’s first discuss how the Operating System uses the resources present. A process in an operating system uses resources in the following way. 

- Requests a resource 
- Use the resource 
- Releases the resource 

A situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s). For example, in the below diagram, Process 1 is holding Resource 1 and waiting for resource 2 which is acquired by process 2, and process 2 is waiting for resource 1.

### Necessary Conditions for Deadlock in OS

Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) 

- **Mutual Exclusion:** Two or more resources are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time).
- **Hold and Wait:** A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
- **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
- **Circular Wait:** A set of processes waiting for each other in circular form.


###  Examples of Deadlock

There are several examples of deadlock. Some of them are mentioned below.

1. The system has 2 tape drives. P0 and P1 each hold one tape drive and each needs another one.

2. Semaphores A and B, initialized to 1, P0, and P1 are in deadlock as follows:
- P0 executes wait(A) and preempts.
- P1 executes wait(B).
- Now P0 and P1 enter in deadlock.

| P0       | P1      |
| -------- | ------- |
| wait(A); | wait(B) |
| wait(B); | wait(A) |

3. Assume the space is available for allocation of 200K bytes, and the following sequence of events occurs.

| P0            | P1            |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Request 80KB; | Request 70KB; |
| Request 60KB; | Request 80KB; |

Deadlock occurs if both processes progress to their second request.
