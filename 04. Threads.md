**A thread is a single sequence stream within a process.** 
( When we say that a thread is a single sequence stream within a process, it means that the thread follows a linear, ordered series of instructions or steps, executed one after the other. )

Threads are sometimes referred to as lightweight processes because they share many of the same resources as the parent process but are independently schedulable units.

Each thread belongs to exactly one process. In an operating system that supports multithreading, the process can consist of many threads. But **threads can be effective only if the CPU is more than 1** otherwise two threads have to context switch for that single CPU.

#### Why Do We Need Threads?
- Threads run in parallel improving the application performance. Each such thread has its own CPU state and stack, but they share the address space of the process and the environment.
- Like the processes, threads also have states like ready, executing, blocked, etc.
- Priority can be assigned to the threads just like the process, and the highest priority thread is scheduled first.


#### Components of Threads

These are the basic components of the Operating System.
- Stack Space
- Register Set

## Difference Between Process and Thread

The table below represents the difference between process and thread.

| Process                                                                              | Thread                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Process means any program is in execution.                                           | Thread means a segment of a process.                                                                                                                                         |
| The process is isolated.                                                             | Threads share memory.                                                                                                                                                        |
| The process takes more time to create and terminate.                                 | The thread takes less time to create and terminate.                                                                                                                          |
| It also takes more time for context switching.                                       | It takes less time for context switching.                                                                                                                                    |
| The process does not share data with each other.                                     | Threads share data with each other.                                                                                                                                          |
| The process is called the heavyweight process.                                       | A Thread is lightweight as each thread in a process shares code, data, and resources.                                                                                        |
| The process is less efficient in terms of communication.                             | Thread is more efficient in terms of communication.                                                                                                                          |
| Multiprogramming holds the concepts of multi-process.                                | We don’t need multi programs in action for multiple threads because a single process consists of multiple threads.                                                           |
| If one process is blocked, then it will not affect the execution of other processes. | If a user-level thread is blocked, then all other user-level threads are blocked.                                                                                            |
|                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Process switching uses an interface in an operating system.                          | Thread switching does not require calling an operating system and causes an interrupt to the kernel.                                                                         |
| The process has its own Process Control Block, Stack, and Address Space.             | Thread has Parents’ PCB, its own Thread Control Block, and Stack and common Address space.                                                                                   |
| Changes to the parent process do not affect child processes.                         | Since all threads of the same process share address space and other resources so any changes to the main thread may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process. |
| A system call is involved in it.                                                     | No system call is involved, it is created using APIs.                                                                                                                        |


#### FAQs

==Q. What are the Similarities Between Processes and Threads?==
> The similarities between processes and threads are like processes threads also have unique ID and set of instructions.

==Q. Why are Threads Faster Than Process?==
> Threads are faster than process as it is light-weighted process and requires less resources for execution compared to process.



### What is Multi-Threading?

**Multithreading is a feature in operating systems that allows a program to do several tasks at the same time.**
A thread is also known as a lightweight process. **The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads.** 
For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below.

Multithreading is a technique used in operating systems to improve the performance and responsiveness of computer systems. Multithreading allows multiple threads (i.e., lightweight processes) to share the same resources of a single process, such as the CPU, [[Memory]], and [[Input Output Devices | I/O devices]].



### Benefits of Thread in Operating System

- **Responsiveness**: If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its output can be immediately returned.
- **Faster context switch**: Context switch time between threads is lower compared to the process context switch. Process context switching requires more overhead from the CPU. 
- **Effective utilization of multiprocessor system**: If we have multiple threads in a single process, then we can schedule multiple threads on multiple processors. This will make process execution faster. 
- **Resource sharing**: Resources like code, data, and files can be shared among all threads within a process. Note: Stacks and registers can’t be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers. 
- **Communication** Communication between multiple threads is easier, as the threads share a common address space. while in the process we have to follow some specific communication techniques for communication between the two processes. 
- **Enhanced throughput of the system** If a process is divided into multiple threads, and each thread function is considered as one job, then the number of jobs completed per unit of time is increased, thus increasing the throughput of the system.


### Creation of threads
In C++, you can create and manage threads using the C++11 `<thread>` library. Here is an example that demonstrates how to create and use threads in C++:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;

// Function to be executed by the first thread
void printMessage1() {
    cout << "Hello from thread 1!" << endl;
}

// Function to be executed by the second thread
void printMessage2() {
    cout << "Hello from thread 2!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create two threads that run printMessage1 and printMessage2 respectively
    thread t1(printMessage1);
    thread t2(printMessage2);

    // Wait for both threads to finish execution
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    cout << "Hello from the main thread!" << endl;

    return 0;
}

```


==Q. What is deadlock in OS?==
> A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes is blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.
