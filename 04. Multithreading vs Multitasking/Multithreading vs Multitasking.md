| **Definition**   | Running multiple threads within a single program simultaneously.                       | Running multiple programs or tasks concurrently.                                          |
| **Example**      | Web browser loading a page, handling user input, and downloading files simultaneously. | Listening to music, browsing the web, and typing a document at the same time.             |
| **Scope**        | Within a single program.                                                               | Across multiple programs.                                                                 |
| **Resource Use** | Utilizes CPU resources more efficiently within a program.                              | Manages system resources to allocate time and memory to different programs.               |
| **Purpose**      | Enhances the performance and responsiveness of a single application.                   | Improves overall system efficiency by allowing concurrent execution of multiple programs. |
| **Switching**    | Threads are managed by the program itself.                                             | Programs are managed by the operating system, which switches between them.                |
